            <b>Machine Learning Intern at Bytez</b> Worked on to significantly upgrade the capabilities of the existing LLM chatbot by integrating the Retrieval augmented generation technique, enhancing entry retrieval and overall question-and-answer functionalities. This enhancement ensured that out-of-scope queries were appropriately rejected, resulting in a notable 30% reduction in token misuse. Additionally, I implemented semantic search techniques and seamlessly integrated a vector database, thereby elevating the accuracy of search results and enhancing the user experience in accessing research papers. These enhancements not only optimized the chatbot's performance but also enriched its utility in facilitating efficient information retrieval and knowledge dissemination.</div>

            <b>Machine Learning Reproducibility Fellow at UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/sor23/">Summer Of Reproducibility </a>.</b> Worked on the project, "Using Reproducibility in Machine Learning Education," where I tackled the challenge of reproducibility in academic research, particularly focusing on the domain of machine learning education. This initiative centered around the application of Few-Shot Learning techniques using BERT for Intent Classification. A significant aspect of my work was to demonstrate the surprisingly minimal impact of synonym-based text augmentation on the model's performance.
  
            Additionally, I developed comprehensive educational resources aimed at illustrating the critical issue of incomplete methodology descriptions in academic publications. By highlighting how such gaps can lead to divergent interpretative choices during the reproduction of research, my work shed light on the consequential effects on result validation.
            
            This project not only contributes to the field of machine learning by providing a practical examination of reproducibility challenges but also serves as a valuable educational tool that underscores the importance of meticulous methodological reporting for the integrity of scientific research.

            As a Machine Learning Intern, I worked on the project called Risk statement Extractor where I undertook the  development of a deep learning model utilizing FastText embeddings to tackle the task of predicting the presence of financial risk within textual statements. The project involved the creation of an efficient system: given a document as input, the model would meticulously scan through it, and the result would be presented as a new document where potential risk statements were accurately highlighted.
